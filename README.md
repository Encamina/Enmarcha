ENMARCHA aims to speed up the development of various .NET applications by leveraging robust modules that integrate with popular services and frameworks.

## Overview

## Key Features

ENMARCHA is a collection of modules that can be used to accelerate the development of various .NET applications. Each module is designed to integrate with popular services and frameworks, and can be used independently or in combination with other modules.

In terms of Generative AI, ENMARCHA implement ENGENIA as a core component to help with the develop of Generative AI applications in .NET. ENGENIA is based on the Microsoft Semantic Kernel and it's based of differente modules to help implement all the stacks of a Copilot application.

## üöÄ Core Components from ENGENIA

### [Your data](./wiki/YourData)

ENGENIA help to process your data and make it available for your applications. The approach is to use RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) to help with the data processing and the data augmentation.

### [Foundation models](./wiki/FoundationModels)

ENGENIA help using different LLM and implemente tools to help understand performance and help with the inference.

### [AI Orchestration](./wiki/AIOrchestration)

ENGENIA help with the orchestration of the different AI models and the different AI stacks. The idea is to use the Semantic Kernel to help with the orchestration of the different AI models. 

### [Your Copilots](./wiki/YourCopilots)

ENGENIA help with the implementation of the different Copilots. The idea is to use the AI Orchestration to help with the orchestration of the different AI models and connect with Your Data to help with the data processing and the data augmentation.

### [Plugin Extensibility](./wiki/PluginExtensibility)

ENGENIA help with the extensibility of the different modules. The idea is to use the Plugin Extensibility to help with the extensibility of the different modules.
